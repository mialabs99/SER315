Design Patterns Implementation Documentation

Overview
This document describes the implementation of two design patterns in the racing system codebase:

1 Factory Pattern: For creating different types of races

2 Observer Pattern: For notifying stakeholders about race events

Pattern 1: Factory Pattern

Purpose:
The Factory Pattern is used to create different types of races (Official and Unofficial) without exposing the creation logic to the client.

Implementation Files:
- `RaceFactory.java` - The factory class that creates race objects
- `OfficialRace.java` - Concrete product for official races
- `UnofficialRace.java` - Concrete product for unofficial races
- `Race.java` - Abstract product class


Benefits
- Encapsulation: Creation logic is centralized
- Flexibility: Easy to add new race types
- Error Handling: Validates race types and provides meaningful errors
- Consistency: Ensures proper initialization of race objects


Pattern 2: Observer Pattern

Purpose
The Observer Pattern allows multiple stakeholders (Racers, Administrators, Organizers) to be notified about race events without tight coupling.

Implementation Files
- `RaceObserver.java` - Interface for observers
- `RaceSubject.java` - Subject class that manages observers
- `Racers.java` - Implements RaceObserver
- `Administrators.java` - Implements RaceObserver
- `Organizers.java` - Implements RaceObserver



Benefits:
- Loose Coupling: Observers don't need to know about each other
- Extensibility: Easy to add new observers
- Maintainability: Changes to notification logic are centralized
- Real-time Updates: All stakeholders get notified immediately



Organizers Class Enhancement:
The `Organizers` class now uses the Factory Pattern to create races and implements the Observer Pattern to receive notifications:


Design Pattern Benefits

Factory Pattern Benefits:
1. Centralized Creation: All race creation logic is in one place
2. Type Safety: Compile-time checking of race types
3. Easy Extension: Adding new race types requires minimal changes
4. Error Handling: Consistent error handling for invalid types

Observer Pattern Benefits:
1. Event-Driven Architecture: System responds to events in real-time
2. Decoupled Components: Observers don't depend on each other
3. Scalability: Easy to add new types of notifications
4. Maintainability: Changes to notification logic are isolated

Real-World Application

Factory Pattern Use Cases:
- Creating different types of races based on requirements
- Generating reports for different race categories
- Creating different types of user accounts (Admin, Racer, Organizer)

Observer Pattern Use Cases:
- Notifying all stakeholders when a race is created
- Alerting racers when race results are published
- Informing administrators about system events
- Updating dashboards when data changes
